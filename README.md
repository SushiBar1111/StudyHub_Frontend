# StudyHub - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for **StudyHub**, a mobile application designed to help students find study partners based on shared interests, study location preferences, and learning styles. Built using Flutter (Dart), the app provides an easy-to-use interface for filtering, searching, and connecting with study partners both online and offline.

## Features
- Search & Filter: Find study partners based on subject interest, study location, or learning style.
- Chat Functionality: Communicate with your matched study partners directly in the app.
- Profile Management: Customize your profile with details such as your learning preferences, subjects, and more.

## Notes
- Each feature is modularized to ensure flexibility and scalability.
- This project is a collaborative effort for a college assignment and is not intended for public or commercial use.
- Since this is one of our first mobile app projects, some parts of the code might be unstructured.
